# TryHackMe
TryHackMe-Portfolio — Writeups &amp; Notes

# Rooms

This folder contains my TryHackMe room writeups.  
Each room has its own subfolder with a detailed writeup, redacted screenshots and notes.

## Structure
- `rooms/<Room-Name>/README.md` — full writeup for the room  
- `rooms/<Room-Name>/screenshots/` — redacted screenshots  
- `rooms/<Room-Name>/notes.md` — raw notes & commands

## How I write a room
1. Short summary (goal + difficulty)  
2. Tools & commands used (copy-paste ready)  
3. Step-by-step approach (recon, exploitation, post-exploitation)  
4. Key takeaways and lessons learned

> Security note: I never upload real passwords, private keys or unredacted tokens. Sensitive data is replaced with `REDACTED`.
