# Junior Security Analyst Intro

> *Play through a day in the life of a Security Analyst and experience their everyday duties.*

---

##  Overview
Welcome to the world of cyber defense — a place of constantly evolving threats, where every click could hide an attack.  
In this introduction, you’ll explore the daily responsibilities of a **Junior Security Analyst (SOC Level 1)** and play through a typical workday.

##  1. Security Analyst Journey

As a Security Analyst, you are the first line of defense in your organization.  
Your day often begins by checking the latest cybersecurity news — companies getting breached, new vulnerabilities appearing, and ongoing campaigns being discovered.

Examples of recent incidents (September 2025):
- Record-breaking DDoS attacks  
- Campaigns targeting NATO countries  
- Supply chain compromises  
- SaaS platform breaches and data leaks  

> **Goal:** Ensure your company *doesn’t* become one of these headlines.

##  Your Daily Duties
As a **Junior Security Analyst (SOC Level 1)**, you work in a 24/7 SOC team and mainly focus on analyzing and triaging security alerts.

Typical duties include:
-  Monitoring and investigating security alerts  
-  Participating in SOC brainstorms and team discussions  
-  Collaborating with other departments (IT, Incident Response, Engineering)  
-  Continuously learning about new attack techniques and defenses  

**Question:** Which team do you work with as a Junior Security Analyst?  
 **Answer:** `SOC`

##  2. SOC and Your Team

A SOC is made up of many specialists, each contributing in their own way to protect the organization.

| Name | Role | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Will Griffin** | Senior Analyst | Supports junior analysts, takes over complex investigations after initial triage. |
| **Corey Stevens** | SOC Engineer | Configures and maintains security tools, fine-tunes alerts for better accuracy. |
| **Emily Conway** | SOC Manager | Oversees the team, reports results to upper management, ensures proper workflow. |
| **Daniel Herrera** | Incident Responder | Called during major incidents, handles containment and forensic analysis. |

##  Career Path Goals

As you gain experience, you’ll be able to specialize and move into advanced roles such as:
-  Senior SOC Analyst (deep investigations, threat hunting)  
-  SOC Engineer (tooling, automation)  
-  Incident Responder (forensics, response management)  
-  SOC Manager (leadership, reporting, strategic oversight)

Along the way, you’ll:
- Detect and prevent malware infections (e.g., data stealers)  
- Analyze and stop phishing campaigns  
- Participate in major incidents like ransomware attacks  
- Build detection rules and automations  
- Learn how companies operate internally

##  3. Being a Security Analyst

Being on the defensive front line isn’t easy — you constantly face new challenges and must keep learning.  
You’ll triage alerts, resolve tickets, and work under pressure, but it’s rewarding when you successfully stop real threats.

A typical workday includes:
- 8-hour shifts with multiple alerts and tickets  
- Prioritizing incidents by severity  
- Communicating and escalating findings  
- Documenting every step and action  

> The job can be stressful, but nothing beats the satisfaction of stopping a real-world attack.

##  Lab Tasks (TryHackMe Simulation)

### Task 1
**Question:** What was the malicious IP address in the alerts?  
 **Answer:** `221.181.185.159`

### Task 2
**Question:** To whom did you escalate the alert with the malicious IP?  
 **Answer:** `Will Griffin`

### Task 3
**Question:** What message did you receive after blocking the IP on the firewall?  
 **Answer:** `THM{until-we-meet-again}`

##  Quick Notes / Key Takeaways
- SOC work is **teamwork** — no analyst handles everything alone.  
- Communication is as critical as technical analysis.  
- The basic workflow: **Alert → Triage → Escalation → Response.**  
- Blocking an IP is just the start — always investigate the root cause.
