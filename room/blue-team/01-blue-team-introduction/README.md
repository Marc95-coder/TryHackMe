# Blue Team Path

This folder contains my notes and writeups for the Blue Team learning path.

**Path:** Blue Team Introduction — defensive security & SOC fundamentals.

## Course structure

(Each subfolder contains a `README.md`, redacted screenshots and notes.)

## How I document each subroom
1. Short summary (goal, difficulty)  
2. Tools & commands used  
3. Step-by-step approach (recon → analysis → actions)  
4. Key takeaways + recommended next steps
