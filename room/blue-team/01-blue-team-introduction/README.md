# Blue Team Path

This folder contains my notes and writeups for the Blue Team learning path.

**Path:** Blue Team Introduction — defensive security & SOC fundamentals.

## Course structure
- `01-blue-team-introduction/` — Intro: what is Blue Team & SOC
- `02-soc-fundamentals/` — Roles, processes, MITRE ATT&CK basics
- `03-siem-basics/` — SIEM concepts and hands-on with logs
- `04-log-analysis/` — Log sources, parsing, detection rules
- `05-endpoint-detection/` — EDR fundamentals and hunting

(Each subfolder contains a `README.md`, redacted screenshots and notes.)

## How I document each subroom
1. Short summary (goal, difficulty)  
2. Tools & commands used  
3. Step-by-step approach (recon → analysis → actions)  
4. Key takeaways + recommended next steps

> Security note: No real passwords, private keys, or tokens. Sensitive info replaced with `REDACTED`.
